#Functional Classes

Classes are a powerful form of a function, they are used in creating many, many more similar objects.

Class -> A Construct -> Build many objects

Decorator code accepts object(s) which is going to an argument as an input.  Whilst a class builds the object going to an argument

Functions are just specialised objects.  There is NO interaction between the properties of a function and what is expected to happen when that function is invoked.  They are the core of JavaScript classes, a JavaScript class is a function, which is capable of creating many similar objects.  Another way of putting it, a JavaScript class is any construct producing a fleet of similar objects.
